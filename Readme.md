# Install Unity Script

Unofficial Unity 3D installer for OS X.

# Requirements & Installation

If you're running macOS High Sierra (10.13), you can download and run the script without needing to install anything:<br>
`./install-unity.py --help`

On previous versions of macOS, Python is linked to an outdated version of OpenSSL and can no longer make connections to `unity3d.com`. Either download and install Python 2 from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install it using a package manager like [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) (`brew install python`).

# Introduction

Unity has begun to split their engine into different packages that can be installed separately and offer installers that allow to download and install only the desired packages.

The Install Unity Script taps into this infrastructure and allows to quickly download and install different versions of Unity, without having to download a different installer for each version.

e.g. installing multiple 5.x versions at once can be done using the following command:<br>
`./install-unity.py --package Unity 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3`

This will install only the Unity editor, with no additional packages. The script will detect existing installations in folders starting with «Unity» in the Applications folder and will temporarily move them to install new versions or additional packages for existing versions.

Later, additional packages can be installed (platform packages only available with Unity 5.3+), e.g:<br>
`./install-unity.py --package Mac --package Windows --package Linux 5.3`

# Available Versions

Unity is packaged this way starting from Unity 5.0, the install script doesn’t support earlier versions.

The install script scans public Unity HTML pages and does not discover all versions available. For regular releases, this includes all versions of Unity 5.x.x. For patch releases, this includes only the newest 5 and for beta releases only the ones for the upcoming Unity version (if any).

For older patch and beta releases, specify the exact version number (e.g. 5.6.2p2) and the script will attempt to find it.

If that doesn't work, versions can be added manually by finding the URL to the Mac editor installer containing a 12-character hash code, e.g. `http://netstorage.unity3d.com/unity/2524e04062b4/MacEditorInstaller/Unity-5.3.0f4.pkg` and by calling:<br>
`./install-unity.py --discover URL`

# Selecting Versions

Versions can be specified with arbitrary precision, the install script will then select the latest available version that matches.

E.g. «5» will select the latest version of Unity 5, «5.3» the latest version of Unity 5.3 and «5.2.3» the latest version of Unity 5.2.3.

If no release type is specified, only regular (f) releases will be installed. Add a release letter to include more release types, p will include regular and patch releases, b will include regular, patch and beta releases. Amongst the releases of all selected types, the newest release will be installed.

E.g. «5.3p» will install the latest patch or the latest regular release for Unity 5.3. «5.4a» will install the latest Unity 5.4 release, be it alpha, beta, patch or regular.

# Selecting Packages

Some of the packages are only available in later versions of Unity. Prior to Unity 5.3, the main Unity editor installer includes all supported platforms and they cannot be installed separately.

Use the following command to show all available packages for a given version:<br>
`./install-unity.py --packages VERSION`

If no package is specified, the default packages (same as in the official Unity installer) will be installed. Otherwise, any number of `-p PACKAGE` or `--package PACKAGE` can be specified to select packages, selected packages that are not available for a given version will be ignored.

It's possible to save your own set of default packages, which will override Unity's set in case no packages have been specified. Add `--save` to the command to save the current `-p PACKAGE` and `--package PACKAGE` arguments as your custom default set. Call `--save` without any `-p` or `--package` arguments to clear your set of default packages or use `--unity-defaults` to use Unity's default set over your saved one.

# Offline Installation

The Unity install script can download and install the packages separately, allowing you to install Unity on multiple computers while only downloading the packages once.

By default, packages and all other required files are stored in `~/Library/Application Support/install-unity`. You can use `--data-dir` to change where those files are stored so you can more easily copy them.

First, download the packages using the `--download` flag. Execute the following command to download all required files to the `Unity_Data` folder on your Desktop:<br>
`./install-unity.py --download --all-packages --data-dir "~/Desktop/Unity_Data" VERSION`

Copy the script and Unity_Data folder to the target computer and then call:<br>
`./install-unity.py --install --all-packages --data-dir "~/Desktop/Unity_Data" VERSION`

Instead of installing all packages, you can select which packages to install using multiple `--package` flags. You can also specify multiple versions to download or install many Unity versions at once.

# Activation

The Unity install script can perform headless activation of Unity Personal. This is useful, for example, in continuous integration environments where a virtual machine must be provisioned from scratch before each build. Please read on for caveats.

**Important:** You should complete the regular activation process at least once on some system, in order to complete extra steps such as the user survey, which the install script does not answer. Afterwards, headless activation can be used with the same account.

```
./install-unity --activate --email foobar@example.com --password xyzzy VERSION
```

If either `--email` or `--password` is not provided, you will be prompted to enter them interactively.

The install script attempts to emulate the activation behavior of Unity 2018.2.0f2. Activation may not succeed with other versions, or if the activation server changes in the future. Please let Unity know that headless activation is important, so that we can have a more reliable solution.

You are responsible for following all applicable licensing requirements.

**Security note:** Be sure to obfuscate your password appropriately in your CI configuration (e.g., [instructions for Travis CI][travis-crypto]) and confirm that it does not appear in build logs. The password will be passed on the command line to Unity, where it may be accessible to other users on the same system. It would be wise to use a Unity account dedicated to this purpose.
